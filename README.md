# Arduino Gas Leak Detection System
An embedded system using an MQ-5 sensor and Arduino to detect LPG, methane, hydrogen, and natural gas, triggering visual and audio alerts for safety monitoring.

## Demo

The video shows the system's baseline state, then controlled gas exposure via a lighter that causes LED activation and buzzer alert behavior.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs
- MQ-5 gas sensor (analog signal proportional to gas concentration)
- Power input (USB or 9V battery)

### Outputs
- LED indicator (visual alert when gas is detected)
- Buzzer (audible alert when gas exceeds threshold)
- Serial monitor output (real-time sensor readings used for debugging, calibration, and verification)
